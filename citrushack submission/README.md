CitrusHack project: CITRUSKITCHEN 4/22/2018

Citrus Kitchen is a program that streamlines communication between restaurants and groceries throwing away food, and shelters and soup kitchens collecting that food.

Upon registering to our website, companies are asked for their username, password, location, phone number, email, company name, and type of user (donator or donatee).

Depending on which catagory each user falls under (donator or donatee), they will be taken to a different page. For the donator, they are taken to a page that prompts them for information on the food they are willing to donate. They must fill out the name of the food, the type of food, the quantity, and a time when they are going to throw it away. They can fill this form out as many times as they want.

When a donatee logs in, they are presented with a map that shows their location in the center, and markers indicating all the resaurants that are giving away food. Below is a table that shows all of the donators, their location, their contact information, and all of the food information that they filled out and submitted. 

In the future, we plan to impliment an extensive varification process for all users, making them prove that they are a certified establishment or shelter. We also want to give donatees an option to specify a radius of nearby resaurants, and we want to add the feature where when you click on a marker, it displays all of the information on that specific resaurant below instead of all the resaurants that filled out the form.
